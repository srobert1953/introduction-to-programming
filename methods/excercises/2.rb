# What do the following expressions evaluate to?
# 1. x = 2
# 2. puts x = 2
# 3. p name = "Joe"
# 4. four = "four"
# 5. print something = "nothing"

# Answers:
# 1. Assign 2 to variable x, return 2

# 2. error | No, it assigns 2 into x and prints it!!! return nil

# 3. error | NO, it assigns "Joe" into name and prints it!!! return "Joe"

# 4. assign string four to variable four, return "four"

# 5. I don't know print... but error? |
# But it also assign string into variable and prints it without new line break. return nil

## Conclusion
# I can assign into a variable when using p or puts or print,
# When using puts and print, nil is returned
# when using p, the value is returned
