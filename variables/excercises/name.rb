# 1. Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name
# and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

# 4. Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name,
# saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name.
# Then outputs their full name all at once.

puts "What is your First name?"
first_name = gets.chomp
puts "What is your Last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp

puts "Welcome #{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times.
# You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row.
# Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.

10.times do
  puts first_name + " " + last_name
